Arcade Pong
In this version you can:
- Choose level (Classic, Magnetic, Space)
- turn on/off items that can randomize your player experience
- turn music/sounds on/off.

In order to implement some movement logic mouse is used only in the menu.
Executables folder contains exec-s for Linux and Windows.
All images and music were made by me, sound effects were taken from non-commercial sound libraries,
